# This is a simple quiz game project built in Python with the Tkinter library.

It's still a work in progress, I want there to be at least 10 questions for each difficulty category totaling 150 questions.

The categories are as follows:
- Harry Potter
- Science
- Gaming
- Anime
- Mythology

While the difficuly levels are a choice between:
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

Potential Improvements:

- Button color changes
- Adjustments to the buttons
- Increased question difficulty
- Increased question count
- Reach the 10 question per difficulty-category minimum
- Add animations
- Add pictures
- Change the background to something else
- Sound effects
- Background music
- Question randomization so that they don't start in the same order each time
